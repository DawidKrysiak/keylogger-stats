# keylogger stats

# Why it exists
I just bought a new mechanical keyboard and it's just a little bit too loud for office work. So i decided to mod it (o-rings, maybe a lube?) but I'm not a passionate modder, so I wanted to start with most commonly used keys to have some quick and easy wins. 

# How it works
Just install dependencies (collections, pynput), run the script and once you are done with your typing,hit [Esc] for the statistics to be printed out
